# CSS MIME Type Fix - Deployment Guide

## Problem Diagnosis
The issue was that Netlify's redirect rule `/*` was too broad and was catching ALL requests, including CSS and JavaScript files, redirecting them to `index.html`. This caused:

- CSS files returning HTML content instead of CSS
- JavaScript files returning HTML content instead of JS
- MIME type errors: "Refused to apply style... MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Netlify Redirects (`netlify.toml`)
**Before:**
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**After:**
```toml
# Asset routing - prevent assets from being redirected to index.html
[[redirects]]
  from = "/assets/*"
  to = "/assets/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/js/*"
  to = "/js/:splat"
  status = 200

# SPA fallback - only for app routes (must be last)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 2. Added Explicit MIME Type Headers
Added specific headers for different asset types:
- `*.css` → `text/css; charset=utf-8`
- `*.js` → `application/javascript; charset=utf-8`
- `*.json` → `application/json; charset=utf-8`
- `*.woff2` → `font/woff2`
- `*.woff` → `font/woff`

### 3. Confirmed Vite Configuration
Added explicit `base: "/"` to `vite.config.ts` to ensure proper asset paths for Netlify.

## Testing After Deployment

### Expected Results:
1. **No MIME Type Errors**: Console should be clear of "Refused to apply style" errors
2. **Proper Asset Loading**: CSS and JS files should load with correct Content-Type headers
3. **Working UI**: All styles should apply correctly, no broken layouts

### Verification Steps:
1. **Open DevTools Network Tab**
2. **Hard refresh the page** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check CSS files**: Click on any `.css` file in Network tab
   - Response Headers should show: `Content-Type: text/css; charset=utf-8`
   - Status should be `200`
   - Content should be actual CSS, not HTML

4. **Check JS files**: Click on any `.js` file in Network tab
   - Response Headers should show: `Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8`
   - Status should be `200`
   - Content should be actual JavaScript, not HTML

### If Issues Persist:
1. **Clear Netlify Deploy Cache**: 
   - Go to Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment
   - Trigger a new deploy with "Clear cache and deploy site"

2. **Check Build Output**:
   - Verify Vite build creates files in expected paths:
     - `/dist/assets/*.css`
     - `/dist/js/*.js`
     - `/dist/index.html`

3. **Browser Cache**:
   - Clear browser cache completely
   - Try in incognito/private browsing mode

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Netlify redirects fixed to preserve asset routes
- ✅ MIME type headers explicitly configured
- ✅ Vite base path confirmed
- ⏳ Ready for deployment testing

The fix addresses the root cause: assets being redirected to index.html instead of being served as static files.
