# Breath Safe - Project Context (Split Files)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This file has been split for better management

The original `project_context.md` file has been split into two more manageable files to address context limit concerns and improve maintainability.

## üìÅ Split File Structure

### 1. **`project_context_core.md`** - Core Project Information
- **Project Overview** and Technology Stack
- **Architecture** and Component Structure
- **UI Design System** and Critical Constraints
- **Development Workflow** and Security Considerations
- **Database Schema** and API Integrations
- **Performance Optimization** and Maintenance

### 2. **`project_context_updates.md`** - Recent Updates & Technical Details
- **UI Overhaul** and Design System Updates
- **Glass Transparency** and Text Contrast Fixes
- **Demo Mode Implementation** and Features
- **Connection Resilience System** and Monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring** and CI/CD Improvements
- **Database Updates** and Security Enhancements
- **Technical Implementation** Details and Code Examples

## üîÑ How to Use These Files

### For Development Decisions
- **Always start with** `project_context_core.md` for:
  - Project architecture understanding
  - Critical constraints and protected components
  - Development workflow and security requirements
  - Database schema and API integration details

### For Recent Changes
- **Reference** `project_context_updates.md` for:
  - Latest UI and functionality updates
  - Technical implementation details
  - Recent bug fixes and improvements
  - Performance monitoring and CI/CD changes

### For Complete Context
- **Both files together** provide the complete project context
- **Cross-references** are maintained between files
- **Updates** are documented in the updates file
- **Core information** remains stable in the core file

## üìã Quick Reference

### Critical Information (Always Check First)
- **Protected Components**: Never modify Sidebar, Header, Footer, Card Components, Authentication System
- **Protected Functionality**: Theme System, User Authentication, Air Quality Data, Database Operations, Rewards System
- **Development Workflow**: Live testing on Netlify, GitHub integration, .env for API keys, security-first approach

### Recent Major Updates
- **UI Overhaul**: Complete dark theme transformation (2025-01-22)
- **Glass Effects**: 100% glass morphism coverage across all cards
- **Demo Mode**: Comprehensive demo system with conversion optimization
- **Connection Resilience**: Robust WebSocket monitoring and fallback systems
- **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI with fallback performance checks

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Read** `project_context_core.md` first for project fundamentals
2. **Review** `project_context_updates.md` for recent changes
3. **Reference** both files during development
4. **Update** `project_context_updates.md` when making changes
5. **Keep** `project_context_core.md` stable for core information

## üìù Maintenance Notes

- **Core file** should only be updated for fundamental project changes
- **Updates file** should be updated with every significant change
- **Cross-references** should be maintained between files
- **Version control** should track changes to both files
- **Documentation** should reference the appropriate file
