# AQICN Setup Checklist ‚úÖ

## Status Based on Console Logs

Your console logs show:
- ‚ùå `‚ö†Ô∏è [GlobalData] No environmental data found for any cities`
- ‚ùå `üîÑ [useAirQuality] Falling back to legacy API due to contaminated global data`
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ [useAirQuality] Legacy API fallback successful` (OpenWeatherMap working)

## What This Means

**Good News**: Your system is working, but it's using the fallback OpenWeatherMap API instead of the new AQICN integration.

**Root Cause**: AQICN API key is not configured in Supabase environment variables.

## Required Actions

### 1. ‚úÖ AQICN API Key Works (DONE)
- The test script confirmed the AQICN API key works correctly
- You're getting real air quality data from monitoring stations

### 2. ‚è≥ Configure Supabase Environment Variables (NEEDED)

**Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `bmqdbetupttlthpadseq`
3. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add this variable:

```bash
Name: AQICN_API_KEY
Value: c3a0656354534822c5f985737f17cc133e5ada31
```

### 3. ‚è≥ Test the Integration (NEXT)

After adding the API key, run this test:

```bash
node scripts/test-supabase-edge-function.js
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Updated Content Security Policy (DONE)
- Fixed CSS/stylesheet MIME type errors
- Updated netlify.toml with improved CSP

## Expected Results After Setup

### Before (Current):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [GlobalData] No environmental data found for any cities
üîÑ [useAirQuality] Falling back to legacy API
‚úÖ [useAirQuality] Legacy API fallback successful: OpenWeatherMap API (Legacy Fallback)
```

### After (Target):
```
‚úÖ [GlobalData] Environmental data loaded for 8 cities
‚úÖ [useAirQuality] Using legitimate API data from: AQICN + OpenWeatherMap API
üìä AQI: 101 from monitoring station in Kigali US Embassy, Rwanda
```

## Benefits You'll See

1. **More Accurate Data**: Real monitoring station data instead of estimates
2. **Better Coverage**: Access to more monitoring stations
3. **Real AQI Values**: Standard 0-500 AQI scale
4. **Fewer Errors**: No more "No environmental data found" messages
5. **Improved Performance**: Direct access to official air quality networks

## Troubleshooting

### If tests still fail after adding API key:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Supabase to propagate environment variables
2. Try triggering manual data collection
3. Check Supabase Edge Function logs for any errors

### If you see WebSocket error 1011:
- This is a Supabase realtime connection issue
- Usually resolves automatically
- Doesn't affect data collection functionality

## Timeline

- **Immediate**: Add AQICN_API_KEY to Supabase (5 minutes)
- **Testing**: Run test script and verify (5 minutes)  
- **Automatic**: Data collection runs every 15 minutes
- **Results**: See improved data quality immediately

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Console logs show "AQICN + OpenWeatherMap API" as data source
‚úÖ No more "No environmental data found" messages
‚úÖ AQI values from real monitoring stations
‚úÖ CSS/stylesheet errors resolved
